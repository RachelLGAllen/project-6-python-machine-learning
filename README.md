# project-6-python-machine-learning

For this project I chose my own data, and I used both the Shanghai Ranking of universities and the World Bank's information on government spending on education as a % of GDP. I was looking for a relationship between them, and although I found no strong correlations I did learn how to do a linear regression, stationarize time data, and do supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
